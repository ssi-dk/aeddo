Description: A powerful tool for automating the early detection of disease
             outbreaks in time series data. It utilizes advanced statistical 
             method, including hierarchical models, in an innovative manner to
             effectively characterize outbreak signals. It is particularly 
             useful for epidemiologists, public health professionals, and 
             researchers seeking to identify and respond to disease outbreaks 
             in a timely fashions. For reference on hierarchical models, see
