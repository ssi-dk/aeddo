## R CMD Check Results

## Patch

This patch aims as:

* Transfer maintainership of the R package to Lasse Engbo Christiansen (LSEC@ssi.dk), and change the e-mail address for the previous maintainer to kasper.telkamp@gmail.com, as his affiliation with Statens Serum Institut (SSI) stops - and the e-mail therefore will be a dead link. Refer to e-mail sent by KSST@ssi.dk on Monday the 27th of November at 08:25 with subject 'Transfer of Maintainership for aedseo and aeddo R packages'.

Best regards,

Kasper Schou Telkamp
